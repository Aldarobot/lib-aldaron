Lib Aldaron is a powerful & easy to use library that uses OpenGL/OpenGLES
with SDL2.  It takes care of any compatibility issues there might be between
opengl and opengles and sdl for all supported platforms ( any code written in
this library will run on any supported platform, no extra code writing needed ).
